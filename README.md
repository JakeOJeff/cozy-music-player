# Cozy Music Player
### [ Heavily Inspired by Nashallery’s Music Player ]
A simple and cozy music player built with LÖVE (Love2D), designed to provide a smooth and visually pleasing experience for playing your favorite tracks.

## Features
•	Smooth Waveform Visualization: Enjoy a visually appealing waveform representation of your music, rendered with Catmull-Rom interpolation for smooth transitions.
•	Interactive UI: Buttons for play/pause, next track, previous track, and volume control are designed with smooth hover and click animations.
•	Customizable Volume: Adjust the volume using the heart buttons, each representing a different volume level.
•	Rounded Corners: The player window features rounded corners for a modern and cozy look.
•	Drag-and-Drop Slider: Easily navigate through the track using a draggable slider that updates the playback position in real-time.
•	Track Information: Display the current track's name and album art in a visually pleasing layout.

## How It Works
The player is built using LÖVE (Love2D), a framework for creating 2D games and applications in Lua. It leverages the following modules:
-	**imgbutt.lua:** Handles the creation and management of interactive buttons with hover and click effects.
-	**playback.lua:** Manages audio playback, including play, pause, next, and previous track functionality.
-	**tracks.lua:** Loads and manages track information, including audio files and album art.
The player also features waveform visualization using Catmull-Rom interpolation for smooth transitions, and a draggable slider for easy track navigation.

## Usage
-	**Play/Pause:** Click the play/pause button to start or pause the current track.
-	**Next/Previous Track:** Use the forward and back buttons to navigate between tracks.
-	**Volume Control:** Adjust the volume by clicking on the heart buttons.
-	**Track Navigation:** Drag the slider to navigate through the track.
